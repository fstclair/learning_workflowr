### Methods:

1. Attachment assay to observe and quantify *in vitro* attachment between two cell lines.

2. Transfect an episomal construct containing Nanoluciferase and a Hygromycin cassette (for selection) for easier and accurate quantitation in the presence of pollen.

3. Growth curve by plate reader to quantify *in vitro* swimming cell growth in the presence of pollen exines.

4. Attachment assay on the initial plating to observe and quantify *in vitro* attachment in the presence of pollen exines.

5. Wash attachment assay after 48 hours of attachment to observe and quantify how *in vitro* attachment is affected by the presence of pollen exines.
