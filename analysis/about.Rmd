### Thesis title

> Reducing infection once and floral: Examining the effects of different pollen diets on *in vitro* growth and attachment of *C. bombi*, a parasite of bumblebees.

---

#### Working in [Dr. Megan Povelones Lab](https://megpovelab.com/) at Villanova University.

---

### Methods:

1. Attachment assay to observe and quantify *in vitro* attachment between two cell lines.

2. Transfect an episomal construct containing Nanoluciferase and a Hygromycin cassette (for selection) for easier and accurate quantitation in the presence of pollen.

3. Growth curve by plate reader to quantify *in vitro* swimming cell growth in the presence of pollen exines.

4. Attachment assay on the initial plating to observe and quantify *in vitro* attachment in the presence of pollen exines.

5. Wash attachment assay after 48 hours of attachment to observe and quantify how *in vitro* attachment is affected by the presence of pollen exines.
