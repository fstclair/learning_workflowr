# Box plot of first rep of BW & SF wash attachment assay

---

#### Description

- Quantifying rosette condition after consecutive exine media washes.

- Number of intact or damaged rosettes counted pre-wash (labeled START) and after 1-4 washes of buckwheat (BW) or sunflower (SF) exine media.

- Exine media wash was followed by a gentle wash of PBS for clear imaging of 25 random fields for analysis. 

- One replicate

### Intact rosettes

```{r intact_rosettes, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#import the data sfbw_w_aa_ir.csv

#read.csv("sfbw_w_aa_ir.csv")

df <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Coding/r_examples/practice_plots/sfbw_w_aa_ir.csv") #set data name

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)


# grouped boxplot
# ggplot(df, aes(x=WASH, y=ROSETTES, fill=TREATMENT)) +
#   geom_boxplot()

#reorder the x-axis groups
df$WASH <- factor(df$WASH, levels = c("START", "1", "2", "3", "4"))


#set the colors

colors <- c("coral", "goldenrod1")

#now make the graph
# Plot with reordered groups
ggplot(df, aes(x = WASH, y = ROSETTES, fill=TREATMENT)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Wash number",
       y = "Number of intact rosettes per field",
       fill = "Treatment") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +
  theme_light()

```

Figure 1. Grouped boxplot of intact rosettes for one replicate of wash attachment assay with two exine medias: buckwheat (orange) and sunflower (yellow). Both groups start at a baseline before any exine wash, followed by 4 consecutive washes with 25 random fields at each wash and quantified the number of intact rosettes per field. Intact rosettes washed with sf exine media showed only a couple left per field after wash 2.

### Damaged rosettes



```{r damaged_rosettes, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#import the data sfbw_w_aa_dr.csv

#read.csv("sfbw_w_aa_dr.csv")

df1 <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Coding/r_examples/practice_plots/sfbw_w_aa_dr.csv") #set data name

# library(tidyr)
# library(dplyr)
# library(ggplot2)


# grouped boxplot
# ggplot(df, aes(x=WASH, y=ROSETTES, fill=TREATMENT)) +
#   geom_boxplot()

#reorder the x-axis groups
df1$WASH <- factor(df1$WASH, levels = c("START", "1", "2", "3", "4"))


#set the colors

colors <- c("coral", "goldenrod1")

#now make the graph
# Plot with reordered groups
ggplot(df1, aes(x = WASH, y = ROSETTES, fill=TREATMENT)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Wash number",
       y = "Number of damaged rosettes per field",
       fill = "Treatment") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +
  theme_light()


```

Figure 2. Grouped boxplot of damaged rosettes for one replicate of wash attachment assay with two exine medias: buckwheat (orange) and sunflower (yellow). Both groups start at a baseline before any exine wash, followed by 4 consecutive washes with 25 random fields at each wash and quantified the number of intact rosettes per field. The amount of damaged rosettes in buckwheat exine washes remain low, while damaged rosette numbers increase in sunflower exine washes after wash 1.

> *C. bombi* rosettes washed with SF exine media experience more damaged rosettes than when washed with BW exine media. More replicates and further experimentation can provide significance for these results.

> The parameters impacting infection are likely multifaceted, including effects on both parasites and bumblebees with possible intersections between parasite signaling and development and bumblebee innate immunity and physiology. While the problem is complex, we provide a possible mechanism by which sunflower pollen reduces *C. bombi* infection in bumblebees by blocking attachment and abrading attached parasites.
