# Violin plots of *C. bombi* cell lines 08.076 and WHA1 attachment assay

---

#### Description

Quantifying the attachment efficiency of two culture-adapted cell lines to explore infection capabilities.

Number of single attached cells, individual rosettes, or merged rosettes counted over 72 hours.

After 24 hours, dishes of cells were gently washed with 2 mL of PBS for clear imaging of 25 random fields for analysis. 

After imaging, dishes were gently washed with 2 mL of media and resuspended in 2 mL media for the next 24 hour incubation period.

### Single attached cells


```{r single_attached_cells, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#import the data aa_s.csv

#read.csv("aa_s.csv")

df <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Coding/workflowr/learning_workflowr/data/aa_s.csv") #set data name

library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(forcats)
library(hrbrthemes)
library(viridis)


# grouped violin plot

#set the colors

colors <- c("lightblue", "pink2")

#now make the graph

df %>%
  mutate(HOUR = factor(HOUR, levels=c("24", "48", "72"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill=CELLLINE, y=CELLS, x=HOUR)) +
    geom_violin(position = "dodge", scale = "width") +
  stat_summary(fun = "median", fun.args = list(mult = 1),
               geom = "crossbar", width = 0.5, color= "black",
               shape = 18, size = 0.5,
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +
    theme_light()  +
    labs(x = "Hour",
       y = "Number of individual attached cells per field",
       fill = "Cell line")


```

Figure 1. Violin plot of 3 replicates of individually counted cells per field in cell lines 08.076 (blue) and WHA1 (pink) over 72 hours. Black crossbars represent the mean. The data show a similar amount of singly attached cells at 24 and 48 hours between the two cell lines, and an increase in WHA1 singly attached cells at 72 hours. This increase in WHA1 at 72 hours is most likely due to cells dividing in the center of large rosettes and not having enough room to adhere, but still having the signal to adhere, so they lift up and re-attach as quickly as they can (see Figure 4).

### Individual rosettes



```{r individual_rosettes, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#import the data aa_ir.csv

#read.csv("aa_ir.csv")

df1 <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Coding/workflowr/learning_workflowr/data/aa_ir.csv") #set data name

# library(tidyr)
# library(dplyr)
# library(ggplot2)
# library(forcats)
# library(hrbrthemes)
# library(viridis)


# grouped violin plot

#set the colors

colors <- c("lightblue", "pink2")

#now make the graph

df1 %>%
  mutate(HOUR = factor(HOUR, levels=c("24", "48", "72"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill=CELLLINE, y=CELLS, x=HOUR)) +
    geom_violin(position = "dodge", scale = "width") +
  stat_summary(fun = "median", fun.args = list(mult = 1),
               geom = "crossbar", width = 0.5, color = "black",
               shape = 18, size = 0.5,
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +
    theme_light()  +
    labs(x = "Hour",
       y = "Number of individual rosettes per field",
       fill = "Cell line")

```

Figure 2.  Grouped violin plot of 3 replicates of individual rosettes per field counted in cell lines 08.076 (blue) and WHA1 (pink) over 72 hours. Black crossbars represent the mean. The data show in increase of WHA1 rosettes in all three time points. A decrease of WHA1 individual rosettes at 72 hours can be explained by the increase of WHA1 merged rosettes at 72 hours (see Figures 3 and 4).

### Merged rosettes


```{r merged_rosettes, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

#import the data aa_mr.csv

#read.csv("aa_mr.csv")

df2 <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Coding/workflowr/learning_workflowr/data/aa_mr.csv") #set data name

# library(tidyr)
# library(dplyr)
# library(ggplot2)
# library(forcats)
# library(hrbrthemes)
# library(viridis)


# grouped violin plot

#set the colors

colors <- c("lightblue", "pink2")

#now make the graph

df2 %>%
  mutate(HOUR = factor(HOUR, levels=c("24", "48", "72"))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fill = CELLLINE, y = CELLS,x = HOUR)) +
    geom_violin(position = "dodge", scale = "width") +
  stat_summary(fun = "mean", fun.args = list(mult = 1),
               geom = "crossbar", width = 0.5, color = "black",
               shape = 18, size = 0.5,
               position = position_dodge(width = 0.9)) + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = colors) +
    theme_light()  +
    labs(x = "Hour",
       y = "Number of merged rosettes per field",
       fill = "Cell line")

```

Figure 3.  Grouped violin plot of 3 replicates of merged rosettes per field counted in cell lines 08.076 (blue) and WHA1 (pink) over 72 hours. Black crossbars represent the mean. The data show that while the 08.076 cell line remains a consistent low amount of merged rosettes, the WHA1 cell line gradually increases in merged rosette counts over 72 hours.

# Sample images

Figure 4. Sample images of 08.076 (08) and WHA1 (WH) attachment assay at 24, 48, and 72 hours. A clear difference in attachment efficiency can be seen between the two cell lines, with a dramatic increase in attached cells in the WH line.

> *C. bombi* cell line WHA1 has a greater attachment efficieny *in vitro* and has shown the ability to infect laboratory bumblebees (*in vivo* attachment) and will therefore be used for all future experiments.
