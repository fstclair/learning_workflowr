# Growth curves of swimming *C. bombi* in the presence of SF or BW exines

---

#### Description

Quantifying swimming *C. bombi* cell growth in the presence of BW or SF pollen exines over 72 hours to explore pollen effects on the growth of swimming cells.

*C. bombi* was transfected with an episomal construct containing Nanoluciferase (Nluc), a constitutively expressed Nluc reporter, and a Hygromycin cassette for selection.

Growth was measured in Relative Light Units (RLU) using a plate reader and normalized to the plate using a standard dilution series from 1E1 to 1E6 cells/well to capture cell density in cells/mL.
