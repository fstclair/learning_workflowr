# Growth curve of swimming *C. bombi* in the presence of SF or BW exines

---

#### Description

Quantifying swimming *C. bombi* cell growth in the presence of BW or SF pollen exines over 72 hours to explore pollen effects on the growth of swimming cells.

*C. bombi* was transfected with an episomal construct containing Nanoluciferase (Nluc), a constitutively expressed Nluc reporter, and a Hygromycin cassette for selection.

Growth was measured in Relative Light Units (RLU) using a plate reader and normalized to the plate using a standard dilution series from 1E1 to 1E6 cells/well to capture cell density in cells/mL.

```{r}

# Libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

#upload data
sc <- read.csv("~/Desktop/Coding/workflowr/learning_workflowr/data/swimming.csv") #set data name

# Keep only 3 names
sc1 <- sc %>% 
  filter(treatment %in% c("Media", "BW Media", "SF Media")) 
  
#set colors
cols <- c("blue", "coral", "goldenrod1")

# Plot
sc1 %>%
  ggplot( aes(x=day, y=RLU, group=treatment, color=treatment)) +
