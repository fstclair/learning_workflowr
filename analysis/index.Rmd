My name is Faith St. Clair -- I am a graduate student and research assistant at Villanova University with a focus in molecular and cell biology. 

I research the effects of different pollen diets on attachment and infection of a parasite of bumblebees, *C. bombi*, and their impact on pollinator health and ecosystem status.
